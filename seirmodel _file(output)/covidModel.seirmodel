     Reasoning for the rate calculation:
     1.  Flow Direction: This flow represents infection, moving from 'Susceptible' (S) to 'Exposed' (E).
     2.  Governing Formula: Infection is a contact-based process, typically calculated as (β * I) / N, where β is the transmission rate, I is the number of infectious individuals, S is the number of susceptible individuals, and N is the total population.
     3.  Missing Variables: The calculation requires explicit population values for the number of infectious individuals (I) and the total population (N).
     4.  Conclusion: These population values (I, N) were NOT provided in the user_input section. Therefore, the rate cannot be computed.

     Reasoning for the rate calculation:
     1.  Flow Direction: This flow moves from 'Susceptible' to 'Exposed (quarantined)'.
     2.  Governing Formula: The user input does not provide a specific formula for a direct flow from Susceptible to a quarantined state. Such a flow would likely be a contact-based process, similar to the main infection flow.
     3.  Missing Variables: A contact-based calculation requires explicit population values for the number of infectious individuals (I) and the total population (N).
     4.  Conclusion: No formula is provided for this specific flow, and the necessary population variables (I, N) for any contact-based rate are also missing from the user_input. Therefore, the rate cannot be computed.
