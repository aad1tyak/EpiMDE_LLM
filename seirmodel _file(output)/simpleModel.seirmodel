        1. The formula for the total flow of individuals moving from Exposed to Infectious is σ * E.
        2. This model requires a per-capita rate, which is the rate at which a single individual transitions out of the compartment.
        3. Therefore, the rate for this flow is simply the parameter σ (the latency rate).
        4. The value for σ is given as 1/7 per day.
        5. Calculation: σ = 1 / 7 = 0.14285714285714285.

        Reasoning for the 'Recovery' rate (I -> R):
        1. The formula for the total flow of individuals moving from Infectious to Recovered is γ * I.
        2. This model requires a per-capita rate, which is the rate at which a single individual transitions out of the compartment.
        3. Therefore, the rate for this flow is the parameter γ (the recovery rate).
        4. The value for γ is given as 1/14 per day.
        5. Calculation: γ = 1 / 14 = 0.07142857142857142.

        Reasoning for the 'Loss of immunity' rate (R -> S):
        1. The formula for the total flow of individuals moving from Recovered to Susceptible is ω * R.
        2. This model requires a per-capita rate, which is the rate at which a single individual transitions out of the compartment.
        3. Therefore, the rate for this flow is the parameter ω (the immunity loss rate).
        4. The value for ω is given as 1/365 per day.
